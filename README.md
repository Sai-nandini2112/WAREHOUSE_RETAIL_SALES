ðŸ“Š Project Title: Optimizing Retail and Warehouse Sales Performance Using SQL Analytics




ðŸ§© Business Statement
Retail and warehouse operations face challenges like overstocking, stockouts, lost sales opportunities, and changing consumer demand. To remain competitive, businesses must analyze product performance, stock levels, and customer behavior to make informed, data-driven decisions.
This project leverages transactional and inventory data from multiple retail and warehouse sources to extract meaningful insights that can drive operational efficiency and profitability.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

*Evaluate Sales Performance
 Understand top-performing products, sales trends over time, and revenue contribution by category.

*Optimize Inventory Levels
 Identify understocked or overstocked items to improve supply chain responsiveness.

*Analyze Customer Behavior
 Explore purchasing patterns based on product categories, price sensitivity, and ratings.

*Support Strategic Planning
 Use historical data to inform future sales forecasts and restocking decisions.

#Solution
Using SQL, the project will:

* Clean and structure the dataset into normalized tables (Sales, Products, Inventory, Ratings).


* Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and outliers.


* Build a series of SQL queries and views that generate actionable KPIs and insights.


* Prepare analysis outputs to be integrated into a dashboard (Power BI/Tableau) or reporting tool.
